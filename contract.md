1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, on Teams video call, on Discord)?
We will do call meetings on team online when we want to have a meeting rather than meet in real life as we all live in different parts of city making it inconvenient to meet in real life. We will sometimes meet in real-life before or after our tutorials if we really need to finish parts of our assignment, as that's a time where we are all at university (Thursday before 3pm or Thursday after 6pm). 
2. Where will we record our meeting minutes (e.g. Teams documents, Gitlab Wiki, Gitlab markdown file)?
We will record our meeting minutes on Google Docs then copy it to a Teams document. 

3. Where will we communicate (e.g. Teams channel, Discord, Messenger)?
We will use discord for casual convrsations about the projects such as quick updates, but if it's a more serious topic we will likely use teams to conversate about it
so the markers can easily access it. 

4. What is a reasonable response time for messages/posts when communicating?
A time where we are all awake such as around 12pm-6pm, always make sure to message on the teams or the discord that you are about to make a merge request so someone can accept it straight away, causing no conflicts between requests in the future. 

5. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.
Stay calm and communicate through the differing opinions, we can write the pros and cons for each arguement then come to a group decision of which opinion we should follow. 

6. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. stuck debugging).
    1. Try to fix it for another 5 minutes.
    2. If we are still stuck with the provblem we can ask the team for help.
    3. If none of the team members can do it, then we can go to the help sessions or contact our tutor which will likely help us debug the code. 

7. A day before the due date we notice a team member's work is very broken and incomplete. Instead of waiting until the due date, list the steps we will take to prevent this from occuring in the first place. Note: contact your tutor if this happens as well. 
We can check the code of each person in the group every thrusday when we meet for the tutorial, we can then test these codes and see if there broken or working, if there broken then we will work together to try to tackle the problem. Doing this will prevent us noticing a person's work is very broken and incomplete one day before the due date.
